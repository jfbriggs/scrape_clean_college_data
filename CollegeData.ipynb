The site provides a wealth of information, based on college reporting, for prospective U.S.-based college students in an effort to help them with their decision-making process (providing data relating to areas such as financials, student population and statistics, satisfaction rates, etc).  It's a reasonably full-featured platform, overall, that provides users the ability to dive into the data, track deadlines, and find strong school matches for themselves; among other things.\n",

Once we parse out the information we're interested in, we will organize and clean it using pandas."
